# Welcome
I’m Fabio Meschini (@fabiomeschinidev) and this is my public space where somethime I publish some work or document. 
I am interested in software development so I like to study new programming languages, new techniques and new technologies.  
  I use this space to share all my notes, examples and useful tools. I like to share only what is necessary to start working with a new technology, leaving any further information and updates to the dedicated documentation references: about this I like to know all principal information to start working for then continue studying 'on the job'. The way I like to work follows the the Pareto principle also called  [The 20-80 principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsGwqk_agcQ "The 20-80 principle") which suggests focusing on that part of notions that give the greatest result.

## Tecnology Notes
Below is a list of my notes on different topics 

- Short notes on editing markdown documents
