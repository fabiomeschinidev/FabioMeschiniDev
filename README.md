# Welcome
I’m Fabio Meschini (@fabiomeschinidev) and this is my public space where somethime I publish some work or document. 
I am interested in software development so I like to study new programming languages, new techniques and new technologies.  
  I use this space to share all my notes, examples and useful tools. I like to share only what is necessary to start working with a new technology, leaving any further information and updates to the dedicated documentation references: the principle that I always like to apply is [Pareto principle called 20-80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsGwqk_agcQ "Pareto principle called 20-80")
